# SublimeText2-Snippets
Some snippets I use in my SublimeText2 workflow that will drop a chunk of code in like a text-triggered macro.

As for getting into the complete Whys and Hows, a great article I found on making your own snippets is called [Quickly Insert Text & Code with Sublime Text Snippets](https://www.granneman.com/webdev/editors/sublime-text/top-features-of-sublime-text/quickly-insert-text-and-code-with-sublime-text-snippets/)
by Scott Granneman.

To find the Snippets folders on a Mac, you can either 

1. Use the terminal to `cd` into the folder        **OR**
1. Go to the Finder ⇒ Click on the 'Go' menu ⇒ Select 'Go to Folder..' 

Either way, you're gonna *copy and paste* the following:
`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages`


Now, you really _should_ use the `/User` folder for all of your own snippets, but truth be told, I just put the clips in the dir for the language I want it in.
Because I'm a badass like that. X-P
